        <supplemental_guidance>Effective implementation of privacy risk management processes requires both organizational and information system processes across the life cycle of the organization’s mission, business processes, and information systems. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) are structured reviews (qualitative and quantitative) of both the risk and effect of how information is handled and maintained as well as the potential impacts or harms to individuals and organizations for loss of control or mishandling of the PII. The term “PIA” may refer to the process of conducting such an assessment, or the document produced as a result of that assessment. A PIA-like process benefits an organization and the individuals whose PII is in the information system by enabling the organization to identify, evaluate, and manage the privacy risks for the PII in that system.Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The tools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. Such tools include, but are not limited to, conducting PIAs. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on the timing for developing PIAs for information systems and electronic collections of information. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and are updated when changes create new privacy risks.Information system privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycle of an information system collecting, using, maintaining, and/or disseminating PII. Such privacy risk management processes include, but are not limited to, design requirements, privacy threshold analysis, privacy impact assessments (PIA), and implementation of secure disposition. While Section 208 of the E-Government Act does not require — or prohibit — a PIA for a national security system (NSS), as defined at 40 U.S.C. §11103 (see Section 202(i) of the E-Government Act), an organization may benefit from conducting a PIA or similar privacy risk evaluation on NSS as part of their internal risk management process to ensure privacy risks are identified, evaluated, and managed in information systems containing PII. For this reason, the ARS extends the requirement to develop a PIA to all information systems.</supplemental_guidance>
