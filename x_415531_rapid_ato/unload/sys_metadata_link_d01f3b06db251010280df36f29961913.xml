        <supplemental_guidance>Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall effectiveness of its capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes, for example, the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel/full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals, due to the incident response activities themselves. In other words: an institution’s resources may be consumed and depleted both directly by an incident, and by its need to allocate resources to address the incident.If the organization routinely responds to incidents, and follows the documented incident response plan to do so, then full-scale simulations (or “table-top exercises”) might not be necessary, especially if the documentation produced from the incident response is sufficient to provide a thorough understanding of the breadth and depth of the organization’s analysis and response to the incident (including lessons learned). However, it is often the case that responses to incidents do not exercise the full incident response plan (for example, an incident might not meet the documented threshold requiring the organization to alert the media about the incident).  If the organization uses a historic response to an incident as the basis for the annual incident response capability test, any parts of the incident response capability that were not exercised in the historic response must be tested (either via actual exercises or through simulation) and documented as part of the capability test.&#13;
