        <supplemental_guidance>Procedures and training implementation should:a. Identify employees with significant information security and privacy responsibilities and provide role-specific training in accordance with NIST standards and guidance: 1. All users of CMS information systems must be exposed to security and privacy awareness materials at least every 365 days. Users of CMS information systems include employees, contractors, students, guest researchers, visitors, and others who may need access to CMS information systems and applications;  2. Executives must receive training in information security and privacy basics and policy level training in security and privacy planning and management; 3. Program and functional managers must receive training in information security and privacy basics; management and implementation level training in security and privacy planning and system/application security and privacy management; and management and implementation level training in system/ application life cycle management, risk management, and contingency planning; 4. CIOs, information security and privacy program managers, auditors, and other security-oriented personnel (e.g., system and network administrators, and system/application security and privacy officers) must receive training in information security and privacy basics and broad training in security and privacy planning, system and application security and privacy management, system/application life cycle management, risk management, and contingency planning; and 5. IT function management and operations personnel must receive training in information security and privacy basics; management and implementation level training in security and privacy planning and system/application security and privacy management; and management and implementation level training in system/application life cycle management, risk management, and contingency planning.b. CMS must provide the CMS information systems security awareness material/exposure outlined in NIST guidance on information security awareness and training to all new employees before allowing them access to the systems;c. CMS must provide information systems security and privacy refresher training for employees as frequently as CMS determines necessary, based on the sensitivity of the information that the employees use or process; andd. CMS must provide training whenever there is a significant change in the information system environment or procedures or when an employee enters a new position that requires additional role-specific training.e. Documentation for specialized training may be maintained by individual supervisors at the option of the organization.&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Maintaining security and privacy training records provides the capability for organizations to track compliance with privacy-related training requirements. Under HIPAA, a covered entity must document that the training as described within the regulation has been provided as required.</supplemental_guidance>
