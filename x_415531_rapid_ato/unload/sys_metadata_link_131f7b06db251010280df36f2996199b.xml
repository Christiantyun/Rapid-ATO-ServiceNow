        <control_definition>The organization:a. Enforces physical access authorizations at defined entry/exit points to the facility (defined in the applicable security plan) where the information system resides by; 1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and 2. Controlling ingress/egress to the facility using guards and/or defined physical access control systems/devices (defined in the applicable security plan).b. Maintains physical access audit logs for defined entry/exit points (defined in the applicable security plan);c. Provides defined security safeguards (defined in the applicable security plan) to control access to areas within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible;d. Escorts visitors and monitors visitor activity in defined circumstances requiring visitor escorts and monitoring (defined in the applicable security plan);e. Secures keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;f. Inventories defined physical access devices (defined in the applicable security plan) no less often than every (90 High, 90 Moderate, or 180 Low) days; andg. Changes combinations and keys for defined high-risk entry/exit points (defined in the applicable security plan) within every 365 days, and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or individuals are transferred or terminated.</control_definition>

        <supplemental_guidance>This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Organizations determine the types of facility guards needed, including, for example, professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or information system users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras, monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system components in secured areas. Physical access control systems comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Program provides implementation guidance for identity, credential, and access management capabilities for physical access control systems. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to information systems and/or components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of organizational information systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access to such devices.&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Employing physical access controls that limit access to a facility that are commensurate with the level of sensitivity of the information processed in a facility protects the information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.</supplemental_guidance>
