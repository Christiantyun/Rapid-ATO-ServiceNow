        <control_definition>The organization: a. Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: individual, group, system, application, guest/anonymous, emergency, and temporary; b. Assigns account managers for information system accounts; c. Establishes conditions for group and role membership; d. Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account; e. Requires approvals by defined personnel or roles (defined in the applicable security plan) for requests to create information system accounts; f. Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with Acceptable Risk Safeguards (ARS) requirements and Risk Management Handbook (RMH) standards and procedures; g. Monitors the use of information system accounts; h. Notifies account managers:   1. When accounts are no longer required;   2. When users are terminated or transferred; and   3. When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes; i. Authorizes access to the information system based on:   1. A valid access authorization;   2. Intended system usage; and   3. Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions; j. Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements at least every 90 days for High and Moderate systems or 365 days for Low systems; and k. Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.</control_definition>

        <supplemental_guidance>Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or CISO) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.&#13;

Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Account management is a critical function for developing and implementing an access control framework that is appropriate for the information contained in systems and applications. When implemented effectively, the access control framework provides the necessary constructs for controlling access to PII, limiting disclosure of records about individuals to only those system and application users that have a need for the information to perform their job functions. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user access to PHI and PII.&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:&#13;
&#13;
The identification of authorized users and access privileges include considerations of whether the user will need access to PHI and whether such access may be permitted or required under HIPAA. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user access to PHI. Organizations should establish procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information, to include during an emergency.</supplemental_guidance>
