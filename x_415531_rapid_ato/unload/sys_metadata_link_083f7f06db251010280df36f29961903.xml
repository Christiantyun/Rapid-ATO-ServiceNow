&#13;
If the service provider will be maintaining personally identifiable information (PII) outside of the United States, the organization must evaluate the legal environment of the country in which the information will be maintained to ensure US equities are protected. If the service provider is in the US and the PII is about non-US Citizens, then the organization must address the data transfer requirements of the country whose citizens PII is collected or maintained and must ensure that country’s privacy/data protection legal requirements are met. The organization must coordinate with its legal counsel, privacy office, and Department of State representative in meeting this requirement.&#13;
&#13;
Systems defined as CSPs:&#13;
&#13;
The organization restricts the location of information processing, information/data, and information system services to organization-defined locations based on program requirements or conditions. In no case may the safeguards afforded to sensitive information be less than the safeguards mandates by CMS, federal law, Executive Order, or other authoritative direction.</control_definition>

        <supplemental_guidance>Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
The location of information processing, information/data storage, or information system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the ability of those organizations to successfully execute their missions/business functions. This situation exists when external providers control the location of processing, storage or services. The criteria external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from organizational criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure that data/information storage locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident response activities (e.g., forensic analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information security breaches/compromises. Such incident response activities may be adversely affected by the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or the locations from which information system services emanate.Other countries have different requirements for the protection of PII of either their own citizens or for transfer of PII across national borders. When selecting a service provider, the location for storage, maintenance, or processing must be considered. Some organizations, such as European Union member states, have very stringent data transfer restriction requirements and your organization may have a treaty or other agreement for data exchange and/or protection. Consult with your legal counsel or your organization’s liaison to the Department of State.</supplemental_guidance>
