        <supplemental_guidance>Privacy Training is an effective means to reduce privacy risk for an organization and is mandated by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and OMB M-17-12.Through implementation of a privacy training and awareness strategy, the organization promotes a culture of privacy. Privacy training and awareness programs typically focus on broad topics, such as responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government Act of 2002 and the consequences of failing to carry out those responsibilities, how to identify new privacy risks, how to mitigate privacy risks, and how and when to report privacy incidents. Privacy training may also target data collection and use requirements identified in public notices, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) or System of Records Notices (SORN) for a program or information system. Specific training methods may include: (i) mandatory annual privacy awareness training; (ii) targeted, role-based training; (iii) internal privacy program websites; (iv) manuals, guides, and handbooks; (v) slide presentations; (vi) events (e.g., privacy awareness week, privacy clean-up day); (vii) posters and brochures; and (viii) email messages to all employees and contractors. Organizations update training based on changing statutory, regulatory, mission, program, business process, and information system requirements, or on the results of compliance monitoring and auditing. Where appropriate, organizations may provide privacy training as part of existing information security training.Privacy training may be integrated with general IA training. Examples of jobs or roles that would require job-specific privacy and security training include: human resource personnel who have greater access to PII; system developers who design, develop and implement information systems containing PII; and system administrators who operate and maintain information systems containing PII.</supplemental_guidance>
