        <control_definition>The organization includes the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, in the acquisition contract for the information system, system component, or information system service in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, and organizational mission/business needs: a. Security functional requirements; b. Security strength requirements; c. Security assurance requirements; d. Security-related documentation requirements; e. Requirements for protecting security-related documentation; f. Description of the information system development environment and environment in which the system is intended to operate; and g. Acceptance criteria.&#13;
&#13;
Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
When acquiring information systems, components, or services used to store, process, or transmit personally identifiable information (PII), ensure the following, in consultation with the privacy office, are included in the acquisition contract:  a. List of security and privacy controls necessary to ensure protection of PII and, if appropriate, enforce applicable privacy requirements.  b. Privacy requirements set forth in Appendix J of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4, including privacy training and awareness, and rules of behavior.  c. Privacy functional requirements, i.e., functional requirements specific to privacy.  d. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clauses per FAR Part 24 (clauses 52.224-1, Privacy Act Notification, and 52.224-2, Privacy Act. and Part 39 (clauses 39.105, Privacy, and 39.116, Contract clause), and any other organization-specific privacy clauses.</control_definition>

        <supplemental_guidance>Information system components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an information system. Information system components include commercial information technology products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and security mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include requirements for degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include:   (i) Development processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and   (ii) Evidence from development and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values using assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information security requirements from FISMA.&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Contracts for information systems, components, or services must meet the privacy requirements of the Federal Government. It is much easier, and cheaper, to build privacy into a system at the acquisition phase of the life cycle than it is to bolt it on after the system is already acquired.</supplemental_guidance>
