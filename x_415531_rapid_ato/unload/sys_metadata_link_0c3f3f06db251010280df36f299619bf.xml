Use of contractor owned devices must be documented within the contract and the system security plan, employ information security and privacy protections appropriate for the sensitivity of the data, and be approved by the Authorizing Official (AO) in advance; andb. Use of personally owned devices must comply with HHS and CMS policies and directives on use of personally-owned information systems and components.</control_definition>

        <supplemental_guidance>Non-organizationally owned devices include devices owned by other organizations (e.g., federal/state agencies, contractors) and personally owned devices. There are risks to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use. In other cases, it may be such that the use of non-organizationally owned devices is allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i) requiring the implementation of organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing such connections; (ii) limiting access to certain types of information, services, or applications; (iii) using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or other system components provisioned by the organization; and (iv) agreeing to terms and conditions for usage. For personally owned devices, organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using such devices in operational environments, including, for example, requirements for conducting forensic analyses during investigations after an incident.&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Mobile devices are more vulnerable to loss or theft than other types of computing media (e.g., desktops and servers) due to their portability and widespread use inside and outside of government facilities. This means PII stored on a mobile device is more vulnerable. This security control implements protections for PII contained on any mobile device not owned by the organization, including personal mobile devices, commonly referred to as BYOD.The organization should include in its mobile strategy a method to ensure both the device’s access to PII can be revoked and the device’s PII contents can be remotely removed.</supplemental_guidance>
