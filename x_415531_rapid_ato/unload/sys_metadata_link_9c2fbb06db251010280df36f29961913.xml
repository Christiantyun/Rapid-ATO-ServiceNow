        <supplemental_guidance>Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
When a record is used to make determinations related to a right, benefit, or privilege for an individual, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, requires the information used be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Agencies should ensure the quality of all its PII, even if it is not protected by the Privacy Act. Organization’s data quality assurance process should be commensurate with the impact to an individual’s rights, benefits, or privileges as determined by the system owner in consultation with the organization’s privacy office.Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance of PII. Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into information systems using automated address verification look-up application programming interfaces (API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on the nature and context of the PII, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to validate the accuracy of PII that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to validate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to validate PII that is obtained from sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., a patient’s health data), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the information is to be updated.When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (such as, but not limited to, when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a taxpayer’s income for a recurring benefit or adjudication of an employee’s clearance), organizations should incorporate mechanisms into information systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the information is to be confirmed accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Frequency of confirmation should be commensurate with the impact to an individual’s rights, benefits, or privileges as determined by the system owner in consultation with the organization’s privacy office.</supplemental_guidance>
