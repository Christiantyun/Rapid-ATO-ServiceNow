The organization designs information systems to support privacy by automating privacy controls to the extent feasible, integrating and meeting privacy requirements throughout the CMS Life Cycle, and incorporating privacy concerns into reviews of significant changes to HHS/CMS systems, networks, physical environments, and other agency infrastructures.  The organization also conducts periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act, the organization’s privacy policy, and any other legal or regulatory requirements.</control_definition>

&#13;
Automating privacy controls provides a concrete way of ensuring information systems are behaving in a way that is intended to achieve privacy objectives. Implementation of this control enables organizations to automate application of privacy controls. One simple example, which many organizations have already implemented, is TR-1, “Privacy Notice.” This concept is one part of the most commonly recognized approaches to “building privacy in,” which is sometimes also known as “Privacy by Design.” Privacy by Design is an internationally accepted privacy best practice endorsed by the Federal Trade Commission in their March 2012 Final Report, “Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: Recommendations for Businesses and Policymakers,” and embodies the same principles of the Privacy Act and Section 208 of the E-Government Act requiring privacy protections and safeguards before establishing or operating a system that may contain PII. Privacy by Design calls for considering privacy risks in the design and management of information systems. In addition to building in security and privacy controls discussed throughout the ARS, this control considers additional privacy-specific system characteristics and controls that must be built into the system to address privacy risks.To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems, organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building privacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII, thereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization’s privacy policy. Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in a manner compatible with those purposes.Additional guidance on privacy-enhanced design and development may be found in the HHS Enterprise Performance Lifecycle (EPLC). Regardless of the systems engineering lifecycle used, privacy requirements should be considered during system design and development and validated and verified along with other system requirements. Validation ensures the correct requirements were identified. Verification ensures the requirements were implemented correctly.</supplemental_guidance>
