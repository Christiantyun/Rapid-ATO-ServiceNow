        <control_definition>The organization:a. Establishes and makes readily available to individuals requiring access to the information system, the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior regarding information and information system usage, including:  i. The HHS RoB and Policy for Personal Use of Information Technology Resources; and   ii. Any applicable CMS RoB; and   iii. Any applicable system-specific RoB.b. Receives an acknowledgment (paper or electronic) from such individuals, indicating that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to information and the information system; c. Reviews and updates the rules of behavior every three (3) years d. Requires individuals who have acknowledged a previous version of the rules of behavior to read and re-acknowledge when the rules of behavior are revised/updated and at least every 365 days;e. Informs employees and contractors that the use of CMS information resources for anything other than authorized purposes set forth in the HHS RoB and Policy for Personal Use of Information Technology Resources is a violation of either or both of those policies, and is grounds for disciplinary action, monetary fines, and/or criminal charges that could result in imprisonment; andf. Informs employees and contractors that the use of CMS information resources is subject to the HHS Policy for Monitoring Employee Use of HHS IT Resources; andg. In addition to the HHS RoB, the organization may define a system-level RoB acknowledgement.&#13;
&#13;
Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Pursuant to OMB M-17-12, organizational rules of behavior must include a policy outlining the rules of behavior to safeguard personally identifiable information (PII) and identifying consequences and corrective actions for failure to follow these rules. Consequences should be commensurate with level of responsibility and type of PII involved.</control_definition>

        <supplemental_guidance>This control enhancement applies to organizational users. Organizations consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities, differentiating, for example, between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior for some types of non-organizational users, including, for example, individuals who simply receive data/information from federal information systems, is often not feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for both organizational and non-organizational users can also be established in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the acknowledgment portion of this control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and role-based security training programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior. Organizations can use electronic signatures (or other electronic mechanisms) for acknowledging rules of behavior.Rules of behavior are aligned with HHS requirements and made readily available.&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Rules of behavior govern expectations of system users for systems that handle sensitive information such as PII.</supplemental_guidance>
