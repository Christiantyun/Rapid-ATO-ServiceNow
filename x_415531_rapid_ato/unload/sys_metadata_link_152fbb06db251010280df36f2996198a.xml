        <supplemental_guidance>Because the information system, system component, or information system service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national and/or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Access to sensitive information, such as PII and protected health information (PHI), requires both a valid need to know as documented by an access authorization request and requires a background investigation (or appropriate screening) to ensure the individual being provided access is suitable. These access authorization requirements extend to developers of information systems containing sensitive information.&#13;

Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization.</supplemental_guidance>
