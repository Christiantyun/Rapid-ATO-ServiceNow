        <supplemental_guidance>Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):&#13;
&#13;
Sharing PII with third parties introduces new risks to the individual which, as applicable, requires organizations to establish formal agreements with the third party and to ensure the sharing is compatible with the purposes described in any notice to, and consent from, the individual. Consideration of privacy risks for sharing PII apply regardless of the method used or whether the information remains stored in the system of records. Data removed from an information system covered by a system of records notice (e.g., a Human Resources [HR] database) and shared in another format (e.g., an Excel spreadsheet) must still meet purpose and use requirements of the associated notice. PII not in a system of records that is shared with a third party still must meet the Purpose Specification and, relatedly, Use Limitation FIPPs. For example, data extracts of PII shared via an Excel spreadsheet or database archive must still be shared only if consistent with purposes set out in notices provided to the individual, and in any consent or authorization received from that individual.A “third party” for these purposes is an individual or organization other than CMS and the individual about whom CMS collects and uses information.The organization SOP and, where appropriate, legal counsel, review and approve any proposed external sharing of PII, including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for consistency with uses described in the existing organizational public notice(s). When a proposed new instance of external sharing of PII is not currently authorized by the Privacy Act and/or specified in a notice, organizations evaluate whether the proposed external sharing is compatible with the purpose(s) specified in the notice. If the proposed sharing is compatible, organizations review, update, and republish their privacy impact assessment (PIA), SORN, website privacy policies, and other public notices, if any, to include specific descriptions of the new uses(s) and obtain consent where appropriate and feasible. Information-sharing agreements also include security protections consistent with the sensitivity of the information being shared.&#13;

Under HIPAA Privacy Rule, a covered entity may not use, disclose or request a medical record, except when the medical record is specifically justified as the amount that is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the use, disclosure, or request.  The disclosure and sharing of PHI is governed by the HIPAA regulations.
